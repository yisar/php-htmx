# Actions Folder

This is the place for any scripts that perform actions such as updating the database, logging in/out, etc.

This scripts may well return HTML in response to the action.

## Naming

It is good-practice to name the action files in the form: **verb**-**target**.php

For example:

- *login-user.php*
- *send-message.ph*
- *delete-item.php*
